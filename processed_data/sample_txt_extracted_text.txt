Subject: ConnectIn September 2026 Update: Predictable Growth & Profitability
Hi Team,
I'm thrilled to report that September was our first profitable month in ConnectIn's history. This is a monumental milestone and a testament to the team's relentless focus on building a sustainable, long-term business.
Our growth is now steady and predictable, driven primarily by our best-in-class net revenue retention. We have a balanced go-to-market strategy, with our efficient PLG motion feeding the SMB segment and our targeted sales team expanding our enterprise footprint. Our operations are lean, our brand is strong, and our focus is now on maintaining this balance of modest growth and consistent profitability.
