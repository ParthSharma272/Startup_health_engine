From: Aadi Sharma, CEO, ConnectIn 
Date: July 5, 2025 
Subject: ConnectIn June 2025 Performance Review & KPI Dashboard 

Hi Team, 

June was a month of accelerated growth and learning for ConnectIn. We executed our 
"Summer Scale" marketing campaign, which successfully boosted our top-of-funnel 
metrics, leading to strong MRR and user growth. This push has temporarily increased 
our burn and CAC, as expected, and our focus now shifts to optimizing efficiency and 
converting these new users into long-term advocates. 

Our product stickiness remains healthy, and the team's execution has been 
phenomenal. We are closely monitoring our support volume and are allocating 
resources to improve our self-service channels in Q3. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of our performance across all key metrics. 

KPI Dashboard: June 2025 Performance 

1. Financial Health 

Our financials reflect a strong growth month, balanced with a planned increase in 
spending for our marketing campaign. Gross margins remain excellent, and our
