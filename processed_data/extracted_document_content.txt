●  Excellent Customer Economics: The CLV of ₹60,000 significantly outweighs 

the CAC of ₹15,000, resulting in a healthy CAC-to-CLV Ratio of 4.0. This is further 
supported by a low 3% Customer Churn Rate and a strong 115% Net Revenue

Recommendations / Areas for Focus 

●  Sustaining Growth: While growth rates are good, continually explore new 

acquisition channels and optimize existing ones to maintain or accelerate MRR 
and User Growth. 

●  Operational Efficiency: With a 15.5-month runway, consider strategic 

investments that could accelerate growth or product development without 
compromising long-term financial stability. 

●  Leverage High CLV: Explore strategies to further increase CLV, such as upselling, 
cross-selling, or loyalty programs, given the already strong CAC-to-CLV ratio.
