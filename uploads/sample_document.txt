Subject: ConnectIn March 2026 Update: Freemium Launch & PLG Pivot
Hi Team,
March was a landmark month for ConnectIn as we officially launched our new freemium plan and began our strategic pivot to a product-led growth (PLG) model. Our goal is to dramatically reduce friction at the top of the funnel and let the product sell itself.
The initial results have been explosive. User growth has shattered all previous records. As expected, MRR growth has slowed as many users opt for the free plan first. Our key metrics have shifted: we are now obsessively tracking user engagement (DAU/MAU) and conversion from free to paid. This is a long-term investment in building a massive, engaged user base that will become our future revenue engine.
KPI Dashboard: March 2026 Performance
Category	Key KPI (Official Name)	Value (Mar 2026)	Commentary
Financial Health	Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)	₹72,00,000	Grew 3% MoM. Slower growth is expected as users adopt the free plan before converting.
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)	₹8,64,00,000	Steady ARR, but the user base growth is the leading indicator to watch.
Burn Rate	₹40,00,000	Burn increased slightly due to engineering costs for the freemium tier and marketing to promote it.
Runway (in Months)	22 Months	Still a very healthy runway to see this strategic pivot through.
Gross Margin (%)	78%	Dropped slightly due to the infrastructure costs of supporting a large free user base.
Operating Margin (or EBITDA)	-35%	Margin decreased as we invest in the PLG strategy.
Growth & Traction	MRR Growth Rate	3%	The focus is not on immediate MRR, but on building the user base for future monetization.
User Growth Rate	200%	An explosion of signups following the freemium launch. We've tripled our user base in a month.
Lead-to-Customer Conversion Rate	0.5%	This traditional metric is less relevant now. We now track "Free-to-Paid" conversion.
Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate	2%	The new PLG conversion rate. We have a clear baseline and our goal is to get this to 5%+.
Signup-to-MRR Ratio	₹50	Very low, as expected in a freemium model.
Expansion Revenue	₹2,00,000	Expansion from the existing paid user base continues to be a stable revenue source.
Unit Economics	Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)	₹1,000	A dramatic 90%+ reduction in CAC, driven by virality and organic signups. This is the power of PLG.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV/LTV)	₹2,50,000	LTV of a paid customer is lower initially, as they start on smaller plans.
CAC-to-CLV Ratio	1:250	The ratio is astronomical, but based on a small number of conversions so far.
CAC Payback Period	0.2 Months	Near-instant payback for customers who do convert.
Contribution Margin	78%	Reflects the new gross margin.
Retention	Customer (Logo) Churn Rate	5.0% (Monthly)	Higher churn among the smaller, self-serve paid customers. Expected in a PLG model.
Revenue Churn Rate	3.0% (Monthly)	Higher than before, but manageable.
Net Revenue Retention (NRR)	99% (Monthly)	NRR has dipped below 100%. Improving this for PLG customers is a key focus.
DAU / MAU Ratio	15%	Our most critical metric right now. We need to drive engagement in the free user base to fuel conversions.
Day-30 Retention Rate	40%	Good initial retention for free users. The key is converting them over time.
Day-90 Retention Rate	30%	Stable long-term retention among free users.
Execution & Team	Founder Commitment (Full-Time)	Full-Time	100% committed.
Team Size	42 FTEs	Hired two product managers focused on PLG conversion and user experience.
KPI Update Frequency	Daily	We now track core PLG metrics (signups, DAU/MAU, conversions) on a daily basis.
Time Since Last Fundraise	7 Months	Series A closed in August 2025.
Arr per Fte	₹20,50,000	Efficiency remains high as the team is small relative to the massive user base.
Customer Success	Net Promoter Score (NPS)	+15	NPS is lower among the free user base, who have higher expectations and more feature requests.
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)	75%	Dropped as free users interact with our community support and knowledge base.
Support Ticket Volume	3,500 Tickets	An explosion in support volume, as expected. We are pushing self-service resources heavily.
Average Time to Resolution	30 Hours	Resolution time has increased. Paid customers are prioritized, but free user support is strained.
Onboarding Completion Rate	80%	Onboarding is now our single most important product flow. We are iterating on it weekly.
